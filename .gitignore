# Optional: If you have very large data files in your `data/` directory
# that you don't want to commit to Git (e.g., if they exceed GitHub's file size limits
# or are easily downloadable elsewhere), you can add them here.
# For example, to ignore a specific large CSV:
# data/very_large_dataset.csv
# Or to ignore all CSVs in the data folder (use with caution):
# data/*.csv
